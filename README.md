About the project:

Context: We have seen the rise of interest in crypto currencies here, in the Latin America region. Many new crypto brokers are starting operations and new coins being offered in the region. However, to have information, even for basic operations, is very painful. For example, if I want to buy 100 ETH, where is the cheapest place to buy in Mexico? Or whichÂ brokers have the lower fees? Only in Brazil we have more than 40 brokers, and most of them only let you see the full information after creating an account.

- Since the crypto world is presented as a dangerous activity (or related to virtual crimes) in many news, the very first value we want to show to our potential user is Trust and Confidence, in order to create authority.
- Our platform will gather information from many places in only one. So our users will have an intelligence platform that will allow them to spend less time, have the right information at the right moment, and as a consequence, make wise decisions to make more money.
